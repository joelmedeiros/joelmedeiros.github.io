If you are looking for one more article "how to blink a led" or something using PHP, unfortunately it is not your place, here I will guide you to the correct place for PHP in the Internet of Things (IoT) world and also describe what is this IoT world.
To begin this conversation we need to know what is IoT and what it does to understand where PHP fits in.  

# What is Internet of Things?

The first definition for IoT was made by [Kevin Ashton](https://twitter.com/kevin_ashton) (incredibly) in 1999:
>  A system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors
 
 How you can see it has more than 20 years and this came up as buzzword only few years ago, that time, we didn't have a worldwide connected in internet. After that, in 2008 working for Cisco Systems Kevin bring another definition:
 
 > Simply the point in time when more 'things or objects' were connected to the Internet than people - [That 'Internet of Things' Thing](https://www.rfidjournal.com/that-internet-of-things-thing)

This definition also brings a strong force for IoT in the market, they believe after that year was when it really get started. 

I'd like to make my own definition for IoT:
> Something in the digital world that changes or interacts with physical world or vice versa

Well, in addition to all these definitions I would say *IoT is an ecosystem*, not only a connected device sharing data to internet, but also receiving data and interacting to other people and other devices to have smart actions, nowadays you can play games capturing monsters based on your cellphone location ([Pokemon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/en/play-where-you-are/)),  ent a [bike](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/brazilian-startup-yellow-raises-63m-the-largest-series-a-ever-for-a-latin-american-startup/), [scooter](https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/sao-paulo/business-sao-paulo/uber-launches-electric-scooter-rental-in-sao-paulo/) or a [car](https://www.globalfleet.com/fr/technology-and-innovation/latin-america/news/beepbeep-e-car-sharing-kicks-brazil) unlocking by your phone, cities can change light traffic based on traffic, a house can open or close windows based on weather, everything with a unique outcome: make an action in real world.
This ecosystem starts with *data collection* process, collecting data from smart (or not) devices, external APIs, databases and every bit of information available.
All of these data will be stored in the second level of this ecosystem, *storing data*, for this huge amount of data you may need a data lake to store different types of data (json, bat, csv, database data, and so on)
